[00:17.57] I know when to go out
[00:19.93] And when to stay in
[00:22.81] Get things done
[00:30.31] 
[00:28.11] I catch a paper boy
[00:30.74] But things don't really change
[00:33.17] I'm standing in the wind
[00:35.73] But I never wave bye-bye
[00:41.82] But I try I try
[00:49.32] 
[00:51.53] There's no sign of life
[00:55.01] It's just the power to charm
[00:56.97] I'm lying in the rain
[01:00.02] But I never wave bye-bye
[01:05.73] But I try I try
[01:13.23] 
[01:13.53] Never gonna fall for (Modern love)
[01:16.28] Walks beside me (Modern love)
[01:18.75] Walks on by (Modern love)
[01:21.30] Gets me to the church on time
[01:24.35] (Church on time) Terrifies me
[01:25.29] (Church on time) Makes me party
[01:31.77] (Church on time) Puts my trust in God and man
[01:35.08] (God and man) No confessions
[01:37.49] (God and man) No religion
[01:42.30] (God and man) Don't believe in modern love
[02:03.30] 
[02:22.24] It's not really work
[02:24.37] It's just the power to charm
[02:26.96] Still standing in the wind
[02:29.06] But I never wave bye bye
[02:35.42] But I try I try
[02:42.92] 
[02:42.54] Never gonna fall for (Modern love)
[02:45.12] Walks beside me (Modern love)
